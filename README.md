# Traffic-Saarthi

**Traffic Saarthi** is a smart traffic management and navigation tool designed to help drivers make better routing decisions, optimize travel times, and reduce traffic congestion. This project leverages data-driven insights and machine learning techniques to predict traffic patterns, identify optimal routes, and ensure smooth navigation across urban environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Updates**: Receive continuous updates on current traffic conditions, including congestion and roadblocks.
- **Route Optimization**: Suggests the fastest or least congested route to your destination.
- **Predictive Traffic Analysis**: Forecasts future traffic conditions based on historical data and current patterns.
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Gives navigation priority to emergency vehicles by alerting nearby drivers about approaching emergency vehicles.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: The core server, responsible for data processing, handling traffic data, and generating optimal routes.
- **Frontend**: A user interface for drivers to view navigation details, traffic alerts, and route suggestions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes trained models for traffic prediction and congestion analysis.
